# picoCTF

Hey Guys!! This is where you guys need to search for when it comes to solving the picoCTF Challanges. I'm a rookie too and i am trying to solve as many as i can. Parallelly I'm going through the CTF Primer documentation basics that are published by picoCTF Team. I want to thank the picoCTF team for giving  me this opportunity to enhance my skills through their website and thanks to github for helping me showcase my skills.
